**Title:** Launched my side project: Table Share - stop emailing CSVs

**Body:**

Just shipped something I've wanted for years: a way to share table data without the Google Sheets permission dance.

**The problem:** Every time I need to share a quick data snapshot:
- Screenshot? Ugly, can't copy values
- Google Sheet? "Request access" emails
- Email CSV? Gets buried, version confusion

**The solution:** Paste data → get link → link auto-expires

**What I learned building this:**

1. **Minimalism is HARD** - fought the urge to add features constantly
2. **Cloudflare Workers are incredible** for side projects - free tier handles thousands of requests/day
3. **$5 one-time > subscription** for utility tools - people hate recurring charges for things they use occasionally

**Monetization:** $5 one-time via Ko-fi for Pro features (password protection, longer expiry, remove branding). Zero sales so far but just started distribution.

**Try it:** https://table-share.org
