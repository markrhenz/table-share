# Table Share - Social Media Launch Copy

## Product Hunt Post

**Title:** Table Share - The fastest way to share a table

**Tagline:** Stop taking screenshots. Paste data, get a link, done.

**Description:**
Hey Product Hunt! ðŸ‘‹

I built Table Share to solve a problem I kept hitting: sharing tabular data is unnecessarily complex.

**The Problem:**
- Screenshots are ugly and not searchable
- Google Sheets requires accounts and permissions
- Sending raw CSV text looks terrible

**The Solution:**
Table Share = Paste â†’ Link â†’ Share (< 5 seconds)

âœ¨ Features:
â€¢ No signup required (for you OR recipients)
â€¢ Auto-expires in 30 days (privacy by default)
â€¢ Mobile-perfect responsive tables
â€¢ CSV download for recipients
â€¢ Free forever for most use cases

ðŸš€ Pro tier ($5 one-time) unlocks:
â€¢ 5,000 rows (vs 500 free)
â€¢ Custom expiration (1-90 days)
â€¢ Password protection
â€¢ API access

**Who it's for:**
- Developers sharing SQL query results
- Freelancers sending pricing tables
- Teams sharing quick data snapshots
- Anyone tired of formatting nightmares

**Tech Stack:**
Built on Cloudflare Workers (edge-first, zero cold starts), uses KV storage, PapaParse for parsing. 100% serverless.

## Hacker News Post (Show HN)

**Title:** Show HN: Table Share â€“ Ephemeral table sharing with zero signup

**Post:**
I built a dead-simple tool for sharing tabular data without the overhead of Google Sheets or taking screenshots.

**Core workflow:**
1. Paste data (from Excel, CSV, database query, anywhere)
2. Get shareable link (auto-copied)
3. Send link (recipient needs no account)

Links auto-expire in 30 days. No tracking, no analytics, no accounts.

**Why I built this:**
As a developer, I constantly share SQL query results, API responses, or config tables with teammates. Every existing solution felt too heavy:
- Sheets/Excel require accounts and permissions
- Screenshots aren't searchable/copyable
- Pasting raw text into Slack looks terrible

**Tech details:**
- Cloudflare Workers + KV (edge-deployed, sub-100ms response)
- PapaParse for robust CSV/TSV parsing
- Zero dependencies on frontend (<5KB JS)
- XSS prevention, rate limiting, content filtering built-in

**Freemium model:**
Free tier covers 90% of use cases (500 rows, 50 cols). Pro tier ($5 one-time via Ko-fi) for power users needing 5K rows, custom expiration, passwords, and API access.

Happy to answer questions about the architecture or design decisions!

### r/webdev

**Title:** [Project] Built a zero-friction table sharing tool (Cloudflare Workers + KV)

**Post:**
Hey r/webdev!

Just launched Table Share - a minimalist tool for sharing tabular data without accounts or complexity.

**Stack:**
- Cloudflare Workers (serverless edge functions)
- Cloudflare KV (key-value storage)
- PapaParse (client-side CSV parsing)
- Vanilla JS (no frameworks, <5KB)

**Why edge-first?**
- Sub-100ms response times globally
- Zero cold starts (vs Lambda's ~300ms)
- 100K free requests/day on CF free tier
- Built-in DDoS protection

**Architecture highlights:**
- Stateless design (no databases needed)
- Auto-expiring links via KV TTL (30 days)
- Rate limiting per IP (prevents abuse)
- XSS prevention on all cell content

**Freemium approach:**
Free covers most users. Pro tier ($5 one-time) uses Ko-fi webhook to generate API keys stored in KV - no Stripe, no recurring billing complexity.

Would love feedback from the community! What would you add/change?

### r/SideProject

**Title:** Launched my side project: Table Share (0 to launch in 3 weeks)

**Post:**
Just shipped Table Share - a tool for sharing tables without the friction of Google Sheets.

**Problem:** Sharing data snapshots is harder than it should be. Screenshots are ugly, Sheets require accounts, raw text is unreadable.

**Solution:** Paste data â†’ get link â†’ share. That's it. No signup, auto-expires in 30 days.

**Launch stats:**
- Built in 3 weeks (nights/weekends)
- Zero marketing spend
- Using free Cloudflare tier (scales to thousands/day)
- Monetization: $5 one-time Pro upgrade via Ko-fi

**Lessons learned:**
1. Minimalism is HARD - fought urge to add features
2. Edge computing (Cloudflare Workers) is amazing for side projects
3. No-code payments (Ko-fi) beats building Stripe integration
4. Free tier as marketing > spending on ads

What I'd do differently:
- Built analytics from day 1 (added later)
- Created demo GIF earlier (converts better than screenshots)
- Launched on PH/HN simultaneously for momentum
